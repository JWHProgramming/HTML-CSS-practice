    	<h1>The Supreme Nine:<br>Black Robed Secrets</h1>
		<img src="images/toobin_court.cnn.jpg" alt="Jeffrey Toobin" width="260" />
		<p>Author of the critically acclaimed best seller, <i>The Nine: Inside the Secret World
		   of the Supreme Court</i>, Jeffrey Toobin brings the inside story of one of America's 
		   most mysterious and powerful institutions to the Saroyan stage. At the podium, 
		   Toobin is an unbiased, deeply analytic expert on American law, politics and procedure
		   and he provides a unique look into the inner workings of the Supreme Court 
		   and its influence.</p>
        <p>Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court was published by Doubleday and spent 
           more than four months on the NY Times best-seller list, earning Toobin the 2008 
           J. Anthony Lukas Prize for Nonfiction from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. Toobin 
           has also written several other best-selling books, including <i>A Vast Conspiracy: 
           The Real Story of the Sex Scandal that Nearly Brought Down a President</i>; <i>The Run of His Life: 
           The People vs. O.J. Simpson</i>; and <i>Too Close to Call: The 36-Day Battle to Decide the 
           2000 Election.</i></p>

    	<h3>Fossil Threads<br>in the Web of Life</h3>
		<img src="images/sampson_dinosaur.jpg" alt="Scott Sampson" width="260" />
		<p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage 
		Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, 
		Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's 
		research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has 
		conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.
		<p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from 
		the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or
		horned dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the 
		growth and function of certopsid horns and frills.</p>
		<p>Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American 
		Museum of Natual History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of 
		anatomy at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the 
		University of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of 
		Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural 
		History. His research interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional 
		morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.</p>
		<p>In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological 
		work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was 
		also the on-the-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a 
		book, <em>Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life</em>, which is one of the most 
		comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.</p>
